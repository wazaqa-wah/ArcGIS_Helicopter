# Advanced GIS Class Final Project

This repo contains all the codes that used to pull data from OpenSky API, data cleaning, generate trajectory, figuring out helicopter trips, etc. 
If you want to work with OpenSky API, I hope they can help you.

## Description of the project

The inspiration of the project came from another project that I did with BetaNYC during my internship there. We were looking at helicopters in NYC, but due to the limitation of technology and staffing, we were not able to create the dashbaord on NYC helicopter information that we wanted. However, me and decided to take on this idea and try to make it happen. For me and Jiacheng, we are primarily interested in producing a 3D visual of the helicopter flying routes, some geospatial analysis on the data (places they like to visit, airports they like to stop by), and maybe produce some time series graphs to show when the city is the busiest with helicopters (volumn of helicopters in a perimiter near a location of interest). The 3D graphs and spacial analysis as well as the dashboard are all done in ArcGIS Online/ArcGIS Pro, however, all the data analysis are all donw in Python.

This repo contains all the code documents for data clearning and analysis in that are done in Python. I will break them down by individual documents to help you understand what they all do.
